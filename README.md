### How to Run the Project


### User Stories and Assignments

Each team member is responsible for implementing a specific user story, detailed below:

| User Story | Assigned Member |
|------------|-----------------|
| "As a user, I want to visualize climate trends with various data sets for a chosen location using different types of graphs (line, bar, or heatmap), so I can gain a deeper understanding of the changes over time." | **Team** |
| "As a user, I want to enter a location to view current weather data and forecasts, so I can plan my activities accordingly." | **Akram Klai** |
| "As a user, I want to compare the average temperature trends between two cities, so I can analyze the differences in climate." | **Reena Obmina** |
| "As a user, I want to see a comparison of the average temperature trends over the past 20 years to identify signs of climate change in my city." | **Edison Yao** |
| "As a user, I want to be alerted of severe weather conditions in my selected area, so I can take necessary precautions to keep me and the people I care for safe." | **Bader Alseiari** |
| "As a user, I want a summary of the current weather conditions displayed in plain and easy-to-understand language, so I can quickly understand the weather without having to use a dictionary and do further research." | **Arham Mohammed** |
