## Project Overview

This project leverages weather and climate APIs to provide users with insights into climate trends and real-time weather data for chosen locations. 

### User Stories and Assignments

Each team member is responsible for implementing a specific user story, detailed below:

| **User Story** | **Assigned Member** |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| "As a user, I want to visualize climate trends with various data sets for a chosen location using different types of graphs (line, bar, or heatmap), so I can gain a deeper understanding of the changes over time." | **Team** |
| "As a user, I want a summarized forecast for each day of the upcoming week, including general temperature trends, precipitation likelihood, and significant weather changes, so I can easily plan my weekly activities without delving into detailed data." | **Akram Klai** |
| "As a user, I want to compare the average temperature trends between two cities, so I can analyze the differences in climate." | **Reena Obmina** |
| "As a user, I want to see a comparison of the average temperature trends over the past 20 years to identify signs of climate change in my city." | **Edison Yao** |
| "As a user, I want to have the ability to save my favorite locations, so I can quickly access weather data for those locations without re-entering them each time, and easily manage them by adding or removing entries as needed." | **Bader Alseiari** |
| "As a user, I want a detailed hourly temperature forecast for the current day, including expected highs, lows, and significant shifts, so I can make informed decisions about specific activities during the day." | **Arham Mohammed** |
