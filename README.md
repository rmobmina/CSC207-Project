## **Summary of the Projectâ€™s Purpose**

**The Weather App** was developed to simplify the understanding of climate and weather data for users. The project provides tools to analyze historical and real-time weather trends, compare data between locations, and plan daily or long-term activities based on accurate forecasts.

### **Why This Project Was Made**
- Weather data is often presented in raw formats that are hard to interpret for general users. This project makes the data accessible and visually engaging.
- The project addresses the need for a tool that allows both casual users and researchers to visualize, analyze, and interact with weather trends.

### **Problem Solved**
Understanding climate data can be overwhelming due to its complexity. This project solves this by presenting intuitive visualizations and summaries, making it easier for users to explore weather patterns and trends over time.
